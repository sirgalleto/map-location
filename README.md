## Problem  

We want to show the user a live map of locations that are fetched from a data store. Upon accessing the page the user should see a map around the given locations and it should get updates live if the data is modified elsewhere. Each location at a given latitude and longitude should show the name of the location and a status indicating whether itâ€™s open or not. 
The frontend should have at least basic editing capabilities for locations, and any changes on the backend datastore should be reflected without refreshing.

## Constraints 

* The tecnology stack should follow the following recomendations: 
  * Backend: - Node 8 - Hapi v17, Express or Koa - RDBMS (e.g. MySQL, SQLite, etc.). 
  * Frontend: - React, Vue or Angular (not AngularJS).
* The configuration should tend to cero, so the application could be executed in a couple of commands.

## Tech stack choice 
* Frontend:
  * VueJS
  * Vuex
  * MapBox
* Backend
  * Express
  * Sequelize
  * SQLite
  * SocketIO

## Assumptions 
* A Mapbox _access token_ is going to be provided.
* The solution is not required to run out of the current browser versions.

## Solution proposal 

The problem can be divided in two components: 

* A *challenge API* component that interacts with a datastore where the map locations are located, and expose a RESTFUL endpoint where any client can perform CRUD actions to the location entity, as well as a web socket namespace that sends an event when an update happens.

* A *webclient* that presents to the user a map to interact with the locations exposed in the API, with the ability to create, update and delete the locations retrieved. And, receive the real-time updates via web socket connection. 

### challenge API

#### Overview 

The challenge API_ is a service that interacts with a single table SQLite database, exposes a RESTFUL single endpoint api, and a socket with a `location` namespace.

Adittionally the API implementations includes a workflow to create database migrations where the schema is syncronized with the database. 

#### Location Entity

| Property 	|  Type  	|        Description       	| Required 	|     Example     	|
|:--------:	|:------:	|:------------------------:	|:--------:	|:---------------:	|
| id       	| Int    	| Location Identifier      	| true     	| 101             	|
| name     	| String 	| Location name            	| true     	| Skycatch office 	|
| lat      	| Double 	| ISO 6709:2008 Latitude   	| true     	| 20.665826       	|
| long     	| Double 	| ISO 6709:2008 Longitude  	| true     	| -103.372706     	|
| isOpen   	| Bool   	| Locations is open or not 	| true     	| false           	|


#### Location Endpoints

* Get Location

Request
```
{
    url: "/location/",
    type : "GET",
}
```

Result 
```
 {
  code: 200,
  body: [<Location>]
}
```
* Get Location by Id

Request
```
{
    url: "/location/:id",
    type : "GET",
}
```

Result
```
{
  code: 200,
  body: <Location>
}
```

* Create Location

Request
```
{
    url: "/location/",
    type : "POST",
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    body: {
      name: '<String>',
      lat: '<Double>',
      long: '<Double>',
      isOpen: '<Boolean>'
    }
}
```

Response
```
{
  code: 200,
  body; <Location>
}
```

* Update Location

Request
```
{
    url: "/location/:id",
    type : "PUT",
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    body: {
      name: '<String>',
      lat: '<Double>',
      long: '<Double>',
      isOpen: '<Boolean>'
    }
}
```

Response
```
{
  code: 200,
  body; <Location>
}
```

* Delete Location

Request
```
{
    url: "/location/:id",
    type : "DELETE",
}
```

Response
```
{
  code: 200,
  body: null
}
```

* API Error Codes
  * 404: Resource Not Found.
  * 500: Internal Server Error.
  * 400: Bad Request.

#### Location namespace events

* Location added 

```
{
  eventType: 'CREATE',
  locationId: '<Int>'
}
```

* Location updated 

```
{
  eventType: 'UPDATE',
  locationId: '<Int>'
}
```

* Location deleted

```
{
  eventType: 'DELETE',
  locationId: '<Int>'
}
```

#### Observations 

* The first consideration for the database was MySQL, even though the SQLite possibility of no server maintenance and pluggability was the principal reason for its usage.
* Using the socket.io rooms, where the user should send a room subscription first, and the backend should approve and assign a user to a room was the first approach, however it remains to a no needed backend necessity, reason why using namespaces was the approach to go in order to subscribe to a client only to its topic of interest.

### Challenge Webclient 

#### Overview 

The challenge webclient provides a UI where the user can see a map with the locations stored in the _challenge API_, perform actions to those locations, and create new locations.

### Assumptions
* The user will provide a mapboxToken

### Solution proposal 

This solution can be divided into three main elements 

1. State management.
2. The Mapbox implementation.
3. The final UI to the user. 

#### State management

Using (VUEX)[https://vuex.vuejs.org/] as state management library the concerns we need to take care are:

* _location_ store: Represents the state of the application in terms of locations, including the requests status, and results. 

location store base
```
{
  isFetchingLocations: false,
  isCreatingLocation: false,
  isUpdatingLocation: false, 
  locations: [],
  requestError: {},
}
```

* _location_ Mutations: Focus on the different API comming state changes needed, as well as the data injection comming from the socket namespace 
  * _START_{ACTION}_REQUEST_
  * _REQUEST_{ACTION}_SUCCESS_
  * _REQUEST_ERROR_
  * _SOCKET_{ACTION}_LOCATION_

* _location_ Actions: As the responsibles of executing async requests that finish into a state mutation: 
  * _getLocations_
  * _updateLocation_
  * _createLocation_
  * _listenForSocketActions_


#### Mapbox GL JS Implementation 

Currently a well supported transformation of the mapbox GL JS compoments to VUE is already developed. [Vue-mapbox](https://soal.github.io/vue-mapbox/) covers the different requirements for:

1. Draw a map
2. Draw markers over the map.
3. Attach pins to the markers. 

Example: 

```
<template>
  <MglMap
    :accessToken="mapboxAccessToken"
    :mapStyle.sync="mapStyle"
    :center="coordinates"
  >
    <MglPopup :coordinates="coordinates" anchor="top">
      PopUp!
    </MglPopup>
  </MglMap>
</template>
```

#### User UI 

By the usage of [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com) as UIComponent library, the following user-flows are supported:

* Show locations _from state_.
* Show location details.
* Create location.
* Update location.
* Delete location.

### Observations 
* The `buildVuexAsyncRequest.js` helper is an experimental proposal that remains to a previous idea of the auto-generation of the async-request VUEX flow, wherein the everyday practices, per asynchronous action there are at least three boilerplate mutations, one action, and three new state props.

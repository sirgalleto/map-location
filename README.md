Skycatch technical challenge

## How to run

`$ npm run start`

## Problem  

We want to show the user a live map of locations that are fetched from a data store. Upon accessing the page the user should see a map around the given locations and it should get updates live if the data is modified elsewhere. Each location at a given latitude and longitude should show the name of the location and a status indicating whether itâ€™s open or not. 
The frontend should have at least basic editing capabilities for locations, and any changes on the backend datastore should be reflected without refreshing.

## Constraints 

* The configuration should tend to cero, so the application could be executed in a couple of commands.

## Solution proposal 

The problem can be divided in two components: 

* A *Location API* component that interacts with a Database where the map locations , and expose a RESTFUL endpoint where any client can perform CRUD actions to the location entity, as well as a web socket channel that sends an event when an update happens.

* A *frontend client* that presents to the user a map to interact with the locations exposed in the API, with the ability to create, update and delete the locations retrieved. And, receive the real-time updates via web socket connection. 

### Location API

#### Technology Stack

- Node 8 
- Express 
- SocketIO

#### Overview 

The _location API_ is a service that interacts with a single table SQLite database, exposes a RESTFUL single endpoint api, and a socket with a `location` channel.

#### Location Entity

| Property 	|  Type  	|        Description       	| Required 	|     Example     	|
|:--------:	|:------:	|:------------------------:	|:--------:	|:---------------:	|
| id       	| Int    	| Location Identifier      	| true     	| 101             	|
| name     	| String 	| Location name            	| true     	| Skycatch office 	|
| lat      	| Double 	| Iso 6709:2008 Latitude   	| true     	| 20.665826       	|
| long     	| Double 	| ISO 6709:2008 Longitude  	| true     	| -103.372706     	|
| isOpen   	| Bool   	| Locations is open or not 	| true     	| false           	|


#### Location Endpoints

* Get Location

Request
```
{
    url: "/location/",
    type : "GET",
}
```

Result 
```
 {
  code: 200,
  body: [<Location>]
}
```
* Get Location by Id

Request
```
{
    url: "/location/:id",
    type : "GET",
}
```

Result
```
{
  code: 200,
  body: <Location>
}
```

* Create Location

Request
```
{
    url: "/location/",
    type : "POST",
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    body: {
      name: '<String>',
      lat: '<Double>',
      long: '<Double>',
      isOpen: '<Boolean>'
    }
}
```

Response
```
{
  code: 200,
  body; <Location>
}
```

* Update Location

Request
```
{
    url: "/location/:id",
    type : "PUT",
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    body: {
      name: '<String>',
      lat: '<Double>',
      long: '<Double>',
      isOpen: '<Boolean>'
    }
}
```

Response
```
{
  code: 200,
  body; <Location>
}
```

* Delete Location

Request
```
{
    url: "/location/:id",
    type : "DELETE",
}
```

Response
```
{
  code: 200,

}
```


#### Location channel events

* Location added 

```
{
  eventType: 'CREATE',
  locationId: '<Int>'
}
```

* Location updated 

```
{
  eventType: 'UPDATE',
  locationId: '<Int>'
}
```

* Location deleted

```
{
  eventType: 'DELETE',
  locationId: '<Int>'
}
```

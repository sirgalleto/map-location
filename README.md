Skycatch technical challenge

## How to run

`$ npm run start`

## Problem  

We want to show the user a live map of locations that are fetched from a data store. Upon accessing the page the user should see a map around the given locations and it should get updates live if the data is modified elsewhere. Each location at a given latitude and longitude should show the name of the location and a status indicating whether itâ€™s open or not. 
The frontend should have at least basic editing capabilities for locations, and any changes on the backend datastore should be reflected without refreshing.

## Solution proposal 

The problem can be divided in two components: 

* An API component that interacts with a Database where the map locations are saved and expose a RESTFUL endpoint where any client can perform CRUD actions to the location entity, as well as a web socket endpoint that sends an event when an update happens.

* A frontend client that presents to the user a map to interact with the locations exposed in the API, with the ability to create, update and delete the locations retrieved. And, receive the real-time updates via web socket connection.
